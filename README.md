# disco-diffusion-wrapper
Implementation of a [disco diffusion](https://github.com/alembics/disco-diffusion) wrapper that could run on your own GPU with a batch  of input text. 

Based on this work, an AI painting website (https://6pen.art/) was built, you may have a try.


## What this repo did
1.Separate the model loading and model inference parts of the initial code. Now you can use it like:
```python
# init and load pretrain model.
disco = DiscoDiffusion()
# infer
disco.draw(text, ...)
```

2.Use [deepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to preprocess the text, so that you can use any language you like to draw.
The default language pair is from `Chinese`->`English`(`ZH`->`EN-US`)，you can change it in `run.py` or `run_batch.py`
```python
def translate(text, source_lang="ZH", target_lang="EN-US"):
    res = translator.translate_text(text, source_lang="ZH", target_lang="EN-US")
    return res
```
You can also turn-off text  translation by setting `USE_TRANSLATE=False` so that you don't need the DeepL authKey. 

3.Batch generating & saving.
As the loading part and the inferring part is seperated, you do not need to load pretrain model again for a new sentence. This reduces a bunch of time.
```python
cd disco-diffusion-wrapper/wrapper
# create and fill the sentence.list
python run_batch.py
```
The output images is saved by the name of the  origin text, so you can easily find it even after a deepL.


## Usage
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mazzzystar/disco-diffusion-wrapper.git
cd disco-diffusion-wrapper/
conda create --name disco
conda activate disco
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd wrapper/

# download pretrain model checkpoints
"""If this step is slow, you can download these model mannually from urls in the 
code of mutils.py, then put these checkpoints in the corresponding folder."""
python mutils.py

# Get your deepL API key, then add it to your run.py or batch_run.py to replace:
USE_TRANSLATE=True
auth_key = ""

# generated image by one sentence
python run.py "一行白鹭上青天"

# batch generation
touch sentence.list
# fill your text in, one by a line.
python run_batch.py
```

If you use this project and produced some interesting results, submissions are welcomed.



## Problems
As it's for fun, I did not look much into the details, and deleted many features(such as VR/3D/Video ...) to make me faster and more clear on the project resonctruction. It's awesome if you're interested in restoring the original function, PR is wellcomed.
